            <p>Later you will be asked to draw your
            community, but before that happens you will have an opportunity
            to learn how to draw on a map. On the map you will see 4 markers.
            Click on the "Start drawing" button to begin the drawing process.
            Click on each in turn to draw a shape on the map. Clicking again 
            on the first item ends drawing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            If you make a mistake, you may restart
            the drawing by clicking the "Try again" button. Then click the
            "Start drawing" button to begin drawing again.
            You may also wish to trace the lake more closely by
            adding additional points to your shape. Feel free to practice
            several times. When you are done practicing click the "Continue" button.

Once you can see your community, click the "Add Community" button to start drawing on the map. Either connect your shape or double click to finalize your community drawing. You may add as many shapes as you wish to describe your community by clicking "Add Community." When you are done drawing your community, click the "Continue" button.

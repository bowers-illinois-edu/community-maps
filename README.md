# Community Maps

This is the HTML and JavaScript to create the community mapping demo hosted at [http://bowers-illinois-edu.github.com/community-maps/](http://bowers-illinois-edu.github.com/community-maps/).

## Local Development

With version 3 of the Google Maps API you no longer need to have a local Apache instance. You should be able to drag `index.html` into any browswer.

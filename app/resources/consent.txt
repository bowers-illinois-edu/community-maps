Thank you for taking part in our Mapping Communities Survey earlier
this spring and agreeing to participate in a short follow-up.

As you may remember, we are conducting a study about how Canadians feel about
their communities. Today we invite you to answer one more short online survey.
This survey follows the first one, but adds some interesting questions about
political leaders as well as offering another opportunity to draw on a Google
map. We think it should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

Your responses are confidential and secure. Once you begin the survey,
you can choose not to answer any particular question. You can also
take a break from the survey and come back to finish it
later. <strong>During this survey, please do not use your back button
on your browser. You will not be able to go back and change your
answers, so consider your responses carefully.</strong>

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at
admin@mappingcommunities.ca. We greatly appreciate your participation.

We recommend you take this survey using one of the following browsers:
Firefox (version 4 or later), Internet Explorer (version 8 or later),
Chrome (version 15 or later), or Safari (version 5 or later). Other
browsers may work, but have not been tested. We have tested
successfully on some mobile devices, but some devices may not be
supported. If you have any questions or comments about browser
support, please email admin@mappingcommunities.ca.

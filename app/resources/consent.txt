Thank you for completing Vote Compass during the 2011 Federal Election
and agreeing to be contacted for future studies.

We are currently conducting a study of Canadians' perceptions of their
communities and their political views.
To that end, we invite you to answer a short online survey involving
drawing on maps and answering questions about Canada's changing
society. The survey aims to help researchers and policy makers learn
about Canadian society and also to test a new way to
ask people questions (specifically, it involves the first ever use of
online drawings on maps). It will take less than 20 minutes to
complete.

Your responses are confidential and secure. Once you begin the survey,
you can choose not to answer any particular question. You can also
take a break from the survey and come back to finish it later.
During this survey, please do not use your back button on your
browser. You will not be able to go back and change your answers, so
consider your responses carefully.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a
href="mailto:admin@mappingcommunities.ca">admin@mappingcommunities.ca</a>. We
greatly appreciate your participation.

We recommend you take this survey using one of the following browsers:
Firefox (version 4 or later), Internet Explorer (version 8 or later),
Chrome (version 15 or later), or Safari (version 5 or later). Other
browsers may work, but have not been tested. We have tested
successfully on some mobile devices, but some devices may not be
supported. If you have any questions or comments about browser
support, please email <a
